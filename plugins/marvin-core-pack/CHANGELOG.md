## [1.0.0-alpha.1] — 2026-05-20

**Breaking:** migration to MCP-first architecture (see [ADR-0002](../../docs/adr/0002-mcp-first-architecture.md)) — hybrid model with skills as source of truth.

### Added

- MCP server `marvin-core` (bundled to `mcp/server/dist/server.js`) exposing 10 prompts under `/marvin-core:*`.

### Changed

- MCP prompts exposed as `/marvin-core:<name>` (new slash entry, 10 prompts).
- `SKILL.md` files now serve **three doors**: Claude Code auto-discovery, the short `/mn.<name>` markdown command, and the MCP prompt (frontmatter stripped at request time).

### Removed

- `mn.eject` skill and command, and the entire scaffold/eject mechanism (the `marvin` CLI is gone).

### Kept

- All 10 skills in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (`mn.commit`, `mn.pr`, `mn.review`, `mn.debug`, `mn.adr`, `mn.changelog`, `mn.readme`, `mn.migration-plan`, `mn.explaining-code`, `mn.docs-search`).
- All 10 `/mn.*` markdown slash commands under `commands/` — short aliases that delegate to the same SKILL.md.
- Agents (`onboarding-guide`, `research`) — unchanged.
- External MCP servers (`context7`, `gitmcp`) — registered alongside `marvin-core`.
